# Advanced-Centrifugal-Trajectory-Launching-System-for-NSLV


# 📌 Overview
 This repository contains the project "Advanced Centrifugal Trajectory Launching System for NSLV", developed as part of the II Semester BE Mini-Project (Course Code: 22IDT28) at Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), Karnataka. The project aims to revolutionize nano-satellite launch vehicles (NSLVs) using a centrifuge-assisted rocket launch system to reduce launch costs and fuel consumption significantly


# 🎯 Project Objectives
 1. Develop a high-speed centrifugal launcher capable of imparting significant angular momentum to a rocket.
 2. Design a precise timing and control module using Arduino, tank circuits, and motor relays to optimize launch conditions.
 3. Implement a momentum and altitude-based booster ignition system to extend rocket trajectory post-launch.
 4. For analysis, measure launch parameters such as velocity, energy efficiency, and trajectory distance

 
# 🔬 Methodology
 1. A high-speed centrifuge system spins the rocket at 150-300 RPM to generate angular momentum.
 2. The controlled launch mechanism releases the rocket at optimal velocity using timing circuits.
 3. Boost ignition system activates when centrifugal force depletes, ensuring extended flight.
 4. Performance evaluation is conducted by analyzing speed, energy consumption, and launch stability
